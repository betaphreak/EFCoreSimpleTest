# Entity Framework Core Simple Example

This sample project uses the nHydrate modeler to define a two entity model. There is a Customer and Order entity related by a relationship on CustomerId. It demonstrates how to build a simple model, as well as how the audit fields work. All entity code is generated and the created by/date and modified by/dates fields are handled by the framework.
